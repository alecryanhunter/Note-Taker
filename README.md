# Note Taker

## Description

This website is a note-taking website. It allows you to add notes to a list, delete them, and view them. They persist through sessions since the data is stored server-side.

This challenge was very useful for giving me an entire back-end to develop, which really helped solidify my Express skills. There were many things I missed that I had to learn while working on this, which I'll now remember much easier. I also attempted adding the DELETE route, which seemed much more daunting than it turned out to be.

## Usage

The website can be found [here!](https://arh-note-taker.herokuapp.com/)

## Credits

This website uses Express.js to handle requests. The website is hosted via Heroku. Starter code for this project was provided by the bootcamp, encompassing the entire front-end. The index.js file handling routing was done by me.
